# Chilean Lead Sources for Laboratory and Industrial Equipment Buyers

**Part I** (below): market map, public sources, keyword packs, and outreach framing. **Part II** (end of doc): implementation analysis — how this scope fits the OrigenLab repo and effort levels. *Former standalone doc:* `CHILE_LEAD_SOURCES_IMPLEMENTATION_ANALYSIS.md` now redirects to Part II.

## Executive summary

Chile has unusually strong **public and quasi-public signal** for laboratory/industrial equipment demand because (a) most public institutions buy through **public procurement**, (b) many laboratories must appear in **official registries** (accreditation, environmental authorization, sectoral authorizations), and (c) research activity is trackable through national **funding and center** frameworks. The result is that you can build a high-quality prospect list without buying data—then selectively add paid enrichment later.

The highest-leverage engines for new customers in Chile are:

- **Public procurement intelligence**: Use the Mercado Público / ChileCompra ecosystem to identify **who buys** (buyers), **what they buy** (line-item descriptions), and **when** (tender calendars, purchase orders), and make a weekly pipeline of opportunities.
- **Accredited and regulated laboratories**: Lists from INN (accreditation directory), SMA (ETFA registry), SAG (authorized labs), SERNAPESCA (authorized diagnostic labs), and ISPCh (recognized labs) reveal **labs that must continuously maintain/upgrade instrumentation**.
- **Research-funded demand**: Use ANID and national "centers of excellence" frameworks to find institutions running funded science and applied R&D, which correlates with demand for analytical and lab equipment.
- **Sector member directories** (fast for private buyers): SalmonChile, Chilealimentos A.G., and Consejo Minero give a curated list of large producers and suppliers with QA and process labs.

What is **not specified** (and would improve targeting): your exact **SKUs/brands**, service coverage (national vs regional), calibration/maintenance capabilities, and which verticals you prioritize (clinical vs food QA vs mining vs academic). The report therefore uses **equipment-category keywords** rather than SKU-level matching.

## Market map and lead-generation thesis

Your equipment categories map cleanly to a few buyer "lab archetypes" in Chile; this is useful because each archetype appears in **different public sources**, and you can cross-validate.

**Analytical / chemistry labs (HPLC, balances, pH meters)**  
Typical buyers: university chemistry labs, food safety labs, environmental labs, mining analytical labs, contract testing firms. These appear strongly in: accredited/recognized lab lists (INN, ISPCh DS 707), environmental ETFA registry, and procurement.

**Microbiology / life-science labs (centrifuges, autoclaves, microscopes, pH meters)**  
Typical buyers: universities, hospitals/clinics, aquaculture health labs, public labs in agriculture/fisheries, and some private biotech. These appear strongly in: Superintendencia de Salud registry (institutional providers), Sernapesca diagnostics lists, university/center frameworks, procurement.

**Industrial QA labs (balances, pH, moisture, microscopes)**  
Typical buyers: wine, salmon, food processing, water utilities, pulp/paper, mining operations, and contractors. These appear strongly in: sector association directories plus the procurement portals of large private buyers (mining/utilities/industry).

The thesis for building a prospect engine is:

1. Start with sources where the **true buyer** is explicit (procurement + regulated lab registries).  
2. Use your business mart to identify which equipment themes are strongest (e.g., "balanza", "HPLC") and build **keyword packs**.  
3. Build weekly lead lists: **new tenders**, **new/updated labs**, **new funded projects**, **member lists**.  
4. Enrich into domains + roles, then outreach.

## Public and official sources to mine first

The table below prioritizes sources that (a) are official or widely relied upon, (b) contain listable entities (labs/organizations/projects), and (c) create **actionable outreach targets**.

## Universities and research centers to prioritize

(Table of institutions with contact roles and URLs — see full report for detailed rows.)

## Procurement portals and marketplaces to monitor

(Table of portals — Mercado Público, ChileCompra, API, CENABAST, Codelco, ENAP, SQM, Enel, Aguas Andinas, Arauco, Antofagasta Minerals, CMP, Collahuasi, Anglo American, Red ProNorte, SAWU, Senegocia.)

## Outreach targets and what to say

### Who to contact first

- **First wave**: Accredited/regulated labs (INN; ISPCh DS 707; SMA ETFA; SAG/Sernapesca). Industry associations' member companies.
- **Second wave**: Public procurement buyers (ChileCompra / Mercado Público): universities, public hospitals, public institutes.
- **Third wave**: Strategic accounts: mining and utilities with vendor portals (Codelco, ENAP, SQM, etc.).

### Suggested contact roles/titles (Spanish)

- "Jefe(a) de Laboratorio" / "Director(a) de Laboratorio"
- "Encargado(a) de Calidad" / "Jefe(a) de Aseguramiento de Calidad"
- "Químico(a) Analista" / "Jefe(a) de Microbiología"
- "Ingeniero(a) Biomédico(a)" / "Unidad de Equipos Médicos"
- "Abastecimiento" / "Compras" / "Jefe(a) de Adquisiciones"
- "Encargado(a) de Mantención"

### Email templates in Spanish

(Templates A–D for lab/QA manager, university/research admin, public procurement buyer, and follow-up — see full report.)

## How to operationalize this with your OrigenLab business mart

- **Recommended exports**: organization_master, top equipment demand, quote-heavy relationships (CSV/SQLite).
- **External list ingestion**: Parse into `external_entities.csv` (entity_name, city, region, source, source_url, category); enrich domains; join to `organization_master.domain` for "new vs known".
- **Equipment-fit scoring**: +3 regulated/accredited lab list; +2 industry association; +4 active procurement buying; +1 website keywords.

## Ninety-day action plan

- **30 days**: Normalized external leads CSV (INN, ISPCh, SMA, SAG, Sernapesca); minimal procurement alert loop (Mercado Público API + keyword packs); first outreach sprint (100–200 emails). (~25–40 h data + ~10–15 h outreach.)
- **60 days**: Lead enrichment (domains + 1–2 roles); "External Leads" view in Streamlit; weekly procurement scan + monthly regulated-list refresh. (~40–60 h.)
- **90 days**: Full lead pipeline with tracking; two proven sequences with reply/meeting rates; optional paid enrichment. (~60–100 h.)

## Final notes on compliance and practicality

- Prefer official feeds and downloadable registries over scraping; ChileCompra supports data reuse via downloads and API.
- Use the OrigenLab mart to prioritize sectors/equipment that already show strong commercial signal, then expand with regulated lists and procurement.

## Part II — Implementation analysis: repo fit vs email pipeline

This section analyzes how difficult it would be to implement the Chilean lead-sources scope (Part I) **within or alongside** the current OrigenLab email-pipeline project. **Status note:** much of the “easy” layer is now implemented as `lead_master` / `external_leads_raw` / scripts under `scripts/leads/`; treat the tables and effort estimates below as design context and update code paths if they drift.

### 1. What the project already has (strong fit)

| Scope item | Current state | Fit |
|------------|---------------|-----|
| **Business mart** | `organization_master`, `contact_master`, `document_master`, `opportunity_signals` in SQLite; built by `scripts/mart/build_business_mart.py`. | **Strong.** The report’s “export organization_master / top equipment / quote-heavy” and “join external leads to domain” assume exactly this. |
| **Equipment tags** | Keyword-based tags in the mart (balanza, centrifuga, cromatografia_hplc, autoclave, microscopio, phmetro, humedad_granos, etc.) and in the app’s `EQUIPMENT_INFO`. | **Strong.** Aligns with the report’s “keyword packs” and equipment-fit scoring; you can reuse/extend the same tag set. |
| **Domain-centric org model** | `organization_master.domain` as primary key; org name/type guesses. | **Strong.** External lists are “name/location then enrich to domain”; joining on `domain` is the intended design. |
| **Streamlit app** | `apps/business_mart_app.py`: Resumen, Contactos, Organizaciones, Documentos, Oportunidades. | **Good.** Adding an “External Leads” or “Prospectos externos” view is a natural new page/tab. |
| **Export / SQL** | Mart is SQLite; report suggests `sqlite3` + CSV exports. | **Strong.** You can add export scripts or in-app “Export CSV” that match the report’s suggested queries. |
| **Leads pipeline (implemented after this analysis was written)** | `lead_master`, `external_leads_raw`, `lead_matches_existing_orgs`, `lead_outreach_enrichment`; `scripts/leads/`. | **Strong.** Covers file-based ingest, scoring, matching to mart, hunt CSVs, and SQLite enrichment. |

So: **the “internal” side (mart, equipment tags, domains, UI shell, leads tables) is largely in place.** The gap is **optional automation** for each public source (API, scrapers, scheduled downloads) beyond file ingest.

### 2. What would need to be built (by difficulty)

#### 2.1 Easy (weeks, not months)

- **External leads schema and storage**  
  Add a table (e.g. `external_leads` or `external_entities`) with the report’s columns: `lead_id`, `organization_name`, `domain`, `lead_category`, `sector`, `region`, `city`, `source_name`, `source_url`, `evidence_keywords`, `suggested_products`, `suggested_roles`, `contact_*`, `outreach_status`, `priority_score`, `notes`.  
  **Note:** v1 implemented `lead_master` + `external_leads_raw` instead of a single `external_leads` table; same idea.

- **CSV export from mart**  
  Script or app action that exports `organization_master`, top quote orgs, and equipment mention counts to CSV as in the report.  
  **Effort:** Low. A few SQL queries and `pandas.to_csv` or `sqlite3` + file write.

- **“New vs known” join**  
  Query that left-joins external leads to `organization_master` on `domain` and flags `is_new_to_origenlab`.  
  **Effort:** Low. Single SQL view or query; can be exposed in Streamlit. **Implemented** as `lead_matches_existing_orgs`.

- **External Leads view in Streamlit**  
  New section that shows `external_leads` (and optionally the join to mart) with filters (source, sector, priority_score, outreach_status).  
  **Effort:** Low–medium. Same patterns as Contactos/Organizaciones (load DF, filters, table, maybe export button).

- **Keyword pack constants**  
  Central list of Spanish equipment keywords (report’s “keyword packs”) used for scoring and later for procurement/tender search.  
  **Effort:** Trivial. Config or Python dict/list.

#### 2.2 Medium (one to a few months, depending on automation level)

- **Ingestion from “list” sources**  
  - **ANID GitHub CSV:** Download CSV, filter by keyword pack, map to `external_leads` rows (project/institución → org name, optional domain lookup).  
  - **SAG XLSX:** Download from known URLs, parse, map to labs + regions.  
  - **SERNAPESCA PDF:** Parse table (e.g. tabula, camelot, or manual CSV export once), map to labs.  
  - **ISPCh / INN / SMA:** Manual export or one-off scraping → CSV → same loader as above.  
  **Effort:** Medium. Mostly one-off or periodic scripts; variability in format and stability of URLs is the main cost. No dependency on the email pipeline except for the final load into `external_leads` and join to mart.

- **Equipment-fit scoring**  
  Heuristic: +3 regulated list, +2 association, +4 procurement hit, +1 website keywords. Implement as a function over a row (or batch) and persist `priority_score`.  
  **Effort:** Low–medium. Logic is simple; “website keywords” may require a small fetch or manual step unless you add a crawler.

- **Lead enrichment (domain + roles)**  
  From “entity name + source” to “domain” and “1–2 target roles”. Can be semi-manual (spreadsheet + lookup) or automated (e.g. homepage URL from Google/search, then scrape “contacto” or LinkedIn).  
  **Effort:** Medium. Automating it is the bulk; a minimal version is “manual column + script that merges back into `external_leads`”.

#### 2.3 Harder (multi-month or ongoing)

- **Mercado Público / ChileCompra**  
  - **Open data (CSV/downloads):** Download and filter by keyword pack; map buyers to orgs and merge into `external_leads` or a separate “tender_alerts” table. Doable with scripts and cron.  
  - **API (real-time):** Requires Clave Única and ticket; rate limits and terms of use. Building a “weekly digest” or “alert when keyword match” is feasible but has legal/operational dependency (who holds the token, how it’s refreshed).  
  **Effort:** Medium–high. Not technically complex once you have access; access and ops are the main difficulty.

- **Private portals (Codelco, ENAP, SQM, etc.)**  
  Mostly registration and manual monitoring; no need to “implement” inside this repo except to record “we registered” and “we saw tender X” in notes or a simple log.  
  **Effort:** Organizational rather than dev.

- **Fully automated, scalable scraping**  
  INN directory, Minciencia centers, CORFO centers, association member lists, etc., often have no API and varying HTML. Robust scraping (respectful of ToS, handling changes) is a separate project.  
  **Effort:** High if you want reliability and maintenance; medium if you accept one-off or rare refresh.

### 3. Difficulty summary

| Component | Difficulty | Why |
|-----------|------------|-----|
| Schema + load for external leads | **Easy** | Standard CRUD + CSV import; fits current stack. |
| Mart exports (orgs, equipment, quotes) | **Easy** | SQL + CSV; already have mart and SQLite. |
| New vs known join + Streamlit “External Leads” | **Easy** | One join, one new UI section. |
| Keyword packs + equipment-fit scoring | **Easy–Medium** | Simple rules; optional website lookup. |
| Ingestion from ANID/SAG/SERNAPESCA/ISPCh/INN/SMA | **Medium** | Different formats; mostly one-off or periodic scripts. |
| Mercado Público (open data vs API) | **Medium–High** | Open data: scripting. API: access and ops. |
| Enrichment (domain + roles at scale) | **Medium** | Semi-manual is easy; automation is a product. |
| Full scraping of all listed sources | **High** | Many sources, no API, maintenance. |

**Overall:** Implementing the **core** of the scope—external leads table, load from a few key lists (e.g. ANID, SAG, SERNAPESCA, ISPCh), join to mart, priority score, and External Leads view in Streamlit—is **moderate difficulty** and fits well with the existing codebase. The report’s 30–60–90 day plan is plausible: the first 30 days are mostly schema + one or two list ingestions + manual/semi-manual outreach; the next 60 days add more sources, enrichment, and the Streamlit view; the rest is iteration and optional automation (API, scraping).

### 4. Recommended order of work

1. **Define `external_leads` (or equivalent) and a CSV loader**  
   So any list you build (manually or from ANID/SAG/PDF) lands in one place.

2. **Implement “new vs known” query and expose it**  
   Even on a small CSV, so you can see which external leads are already in `organization_master`.

3. **Add External Leads (or “Prospectos”) view in Streamlit**  
   Table + filters + optional CSV export; optionally show `is_new_to_origenlab` and `priority_score`.

4. **Add one or two real ingestions**  
   e.g. ANID CSV + SAG XLSX or SERNAPESCA PDF; run periodically and (re)load into `external_leads`.

5. **Add equipment-fit scoring**  
   So new rows get a `priority_score` and you can sort/filter by it.

6. **Optional: Mercado Público open-data pipeline**  
   Download, keyword filter, attach to buyer orgs; then decide if API is worth the access process.

7. **Keep outreach and enrichment**  
   In spreadsheets or a simple CRM until you need more structure; the mart + external leads already give you the “who” and “how they fit” to drive that process.

### 5. Conclusion

Implementing something like the Chilean lead-sources scope **in this project** is **feasible and of moderate difficulty**. The hardest parts are (a) getting and maintaining access to external sources (especially Mercado Público API), and (b) scaling enrichment and scraping if you want full automation. The existing business mart, equipment tags, and Streamlit app give you a direct path to “external prospect list + join to known orgs + view in app” without changing the core email pipeline.
