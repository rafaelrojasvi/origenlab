# Email-pipeline — agent instructions

**Policy overlay for `apps/email-pipeline/`.** Factual behavior lives in code and canonical docs below. If this file conflicts with **`RUNBOOK.md`** or **`SCRIPT_MAP.md`**, follow the canonical doc.

## Read before acting (in order)

1. **[`reports/out/active/current/manifest.json`](reports/out/active/current/manifest.json)** — canonical vs stale files, known warnings, parked Postgres/API.
2. **[`reports/out/active/current/README_ACTIVE_CURRENT.md`](reports/out/active/current/README_ACTIVE_CURRENT.md)** — operator handoff for `active/current/`.
3. **[`docs/SCRIPT_MAP.md`](docs/SCRIPT_MAP.md)** — which scripts are daily, break-glass, or lab.
4. **[`docs/EXPERIMENTAL_PARKED.md`](docs/EXPERIMENTAL_PARKED.md)** — **read before** Postgres migrate/mirror, FastAPI/React dashboard, Tatiana/ML/dataset, or old campaign pilots.
5. **[`docs/RUNBOOK.md`](docs/RUNBOOK.md)** — procedures (ingest, DNR, equipment-first, campaigns).
6. **[`docs/CRUD_SAFETY.md`](docs/CRUD_SAFETY.md)** — mutation rules and `--apply` policy.
7. **Operator status (read-only):**
   ```bash
   cd apps/email-pipeline
   uv run python scripts/qa/operator_status.py
   ```
8. **Classification layers & send gates:** [`docs/pipeline/SCHEMA_CLASSIFICATION_MODEL.md`](docs/pipeline/SCHEMA_CLASSIFICATION_MODEL.md) — evidence vs safety vs workflow; never gate sends on `lead_research_prospect.classification` alone.
9. **Safety checkpoint (pause marker):** [`docs/pipeline/CURRENT_SAFETY_CHECKPOINT.md`](docs/pipeline/CURRENT_SAFETY_CHECKPOINT.md) — safe loop before outreach; golden rules; what not to build next.
10. Optional context: [`docs/OUTBOUND_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md`](docs/OUTBOUND_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md), [`reports/out/active/current/code_quality_simplification_audit_20260519.md`](reports/out/active/current/code_quality_simplification_audit_20260519.md).

## Hard rules (non-negotiable)

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **No email sending** | Do not run `send_inline_html_email_via_gmail_api.py` or any send path unless the user explicitly orders a send test. |
| **No Gmail mutation** | Do not create drafts, labels, or API writes. **Read-only IMAP ingest** (`05_workspace_gmail_imap_to_sqlite.py`) is allowed when the user asks to refresh Sent truth. |
| **No Postgres migrations** | Do not run `alembic upgrade`, `sqlite_*_to_postgres.py --replace`, or `sync_dashboard_postgres_mirror.py` unless explicitly approved. Postgres is **parked** for daily ops. |
| **No `--apply` without approval** | Imports, backfills, purges, suppression writes, and archive moves require explicit user consent. Default to dry-run / read-only. |
| **No invented contacts** | Do not add buyer emails, DeepSearch rows, or marketing contacts without evidence. |
| **Equipment-first tenders** | Use `equipment_first_operator_queue_*.csv` and aligned `buyer_opportunity_ab_queue_*.csv`. |
| **LEGACY scripts** | **Do not use for current operator work:** `build_buyer_opportunity_queue.py`, `buyer_opportunity_crosscheck_*`, `tender_buyer_outreach_queue_*` — use equipment-first builders instead. |
| **Parked stack** | Read [`docs/EXPERIMENTAL_PARKED.md`](docs/EXPERIMENTAL_PARKED.md) before Postgres/API/Tatiana/ML; not required for ingest, DNR, equipment-first queues, or send safety. |
| **No file deletes** | Unless the user explicitly requests deletion. |
| **Tests for behavior changes** | If you change code (not docs-only), run targeted pytest; see workspace rule *Testing — definition of done*. |

## Runtime truth

- **SQLite** (`ORIGENLAB_SQLITE_PATH` / settings) + **Gmail Sent in `emails`** = outbound safety truth.
- **Postgres + FastAPI + React dashboard** = optional / **parked** — not required to mark sends or build equipment queues.
- **Streamlit** (`apps/business_mart_app.py`) = supporting review UI on SQLite; not autonomous send.

## Safe default workflow

```bash
cd apps/email-pipeline
uv run python scripts/qa/operator_status.py          # read-only verdict
uv run python scripts/qa/check_outbound_readiness.py # read-only DNR/Sent preflight
# Mutations only with explicit approval:
# uv run python scripts/ingest/05_workspace_gmail_imap_to_sqlite.py --folder "[Gmail]/Enviados"
# uv run python scripts/qa/refresh_outbound_safety_memory.py
```

## Makefile shortcuts (optional)

From `apps/email-pipeline/`: `make doctor`, `make safety-refresh`, `make equipment-queue` (optional `DATE_SUFFIX=YYYYMMDD`), `make audit` — see [`Makefile`](Makefile).
